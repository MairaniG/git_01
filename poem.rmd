In fields of gold, where dreams take   flight,  
Beneath the velvet cloak of night,  
Where whispers dance on moonbeam's grace,  
I find a haven, a sacred space.    
 
In every leaf that gently sighs,    
In every star that dots the skies,    
There lies a tale, a song untold,    
A symphony of love, of old.    

The rivers sing their timeless tune,    
Their melodies beneath the moon,    
And in their depths, reflections gleam,    
Of hopes, of fears, of every dream.    

Mountains rise, their peaks aglow,    
Guardians of the world below,    
They whisper secrets to the breeze,    
Of ancient times and mysteries.   

Through forests deep, where shadows play,  
I wander on the pathless way,    
And in the silence, find my voice,  
Amidst the chaos, find my poise.  

For in this world of endless change,  
There's beauty in the vast and strange,  
In every moment, life's embrace,  
A dance of light, a fleeting grace.  

So let us cherish every breath,  
Embrace the life, defy the death,  
And in our hearts, let love reside,  
As we traverse the great divide.  

For in the end, when all is done,  
It's love that binds, it's love  that's   won,  
And in its glow, we find our peace,  
In fields of gold, where dreams release.
