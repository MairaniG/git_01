## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves  
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:  
All mimsy were the borogoves,  
      And the mome raths outgrabe.  
 
“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!  

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
And sorry I could not travel both  
And be one traveler, long I stood  
And looked down one as far as I could  
To where it bent in the undergrowth;   

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
"The sun was shining on the sea,  
      Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
      The billows smooth and bright —  
And this was odd, because it was  
      The middle of the night.  

The moon was shining sulkily,  
      Because she thought the sun  
Had got no business to be there  
      After the day was done —  
"It's very rude of him," she said,  
      "To come and spoil the fun."  

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->
In fields of gold, where dreams take   flight,  
Beneath the velvet cloak of night,  
Where whispers dance on moonbeam's grace,  
I find a haven, a sacred space.    
 
In every leaf that gently sighs,    
In every star that dots the skies,    
There lies a tale, a song untold,    
A symphony of love, of old.    

The rivers sing their timeless tune,    
Their melodies beneath the moon,    
And in their depths, reflections gleam,    
Of hopes, of fears, of every dream.    

Mountains rise, their peaks aglow,    
Guardians of the world below,    
They whisper secrets to the breeze,    
Of ancient times and mysteries.   

Through forests deep, where shadows play,  
I wander on the pathless way,    
And in the silence, find my voice,  
Amidst the chaos, find my poise.  

For in this world of endless change,  
There's beauty in the vast and strange,  
In every moment, life's embrace,  
A dance of light, a fleeting grace.  

So let us cherish every breath,  
Embrace the life, defy the death,  
And in our hearts, let love reside,  
As we traverse the great divide.  

For in the end, when all is done,  
It's love that binds, it's love  that's   won,  
And in its glow, we find our peace,  
In fields of gold, where dreams release.
